# Playing cards
Card game made during corona lock down because I was bored.

## RULES:

- Player needs to guess higher or lower on any side of any row.
- Player can pass the turn after:
  - 3 consecutive correct guesses.
  - Making 1 row to be the longest, does not matter which row. 
- Player is always free to keep going, but streaks always reset after an incorrect guess.


### These rules are not implemented in any way, so you can do whatever.
